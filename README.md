First project for Quickstart Bootcamp.
This website is a coffee shop with a shared workspace reservations.

The homepage allows the user to navigate through different pages on the website as well as containing a carousel of images relevent to the coffee shop.

The "About Us" page is a simple page about the coffee shop and owner

The Book page is to reserve a workspace by filling out a form including details of party size, date, and time that the workspace would like to be reserved.

The menu dropdown includes a link to the Food and Drink menus, both include pictures of items you can buy at the coffee shop as well as hoverover popouts of the prices of the products.

Technologies Used (.html, .css, .json, .php)

Ideas for future improvement:
1. Updated menus for the Food and Drink pages.  Including better user interaction with the item pictures (ie. hoverover price over the image instead of popover)

2. Updated booking form that can save user information

3. Login page where users can log on with saved information from the past

4. New page with hours of operation
